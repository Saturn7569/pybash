# PyBash

A python bash toy I made because I was bored...

## Installing

First clone this repository into you computer.
You need to have python installed because I don't have a stable build yet
Now cd into the directory and run these commands:

```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

This will install the [`uv`](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) package and `toml` to open the config file

## Running

Now that you have [`uv`](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) installed you can run the `pybash.py` file with

```sh
uv run pybash.py
```
